# Data-Analysis-with-Python-NumPy-Pandas

This repository consists of some of the assignments and hands-on practices that I have done by taking the Data Analysis with Python: NumPy & Pandas Masterclass course on [Maven Analytics]([url](https://courses.mavenanalytics.io/courses/take/python-pandas/lessons/36997236-creating-a-dataframe)https://courses.mavenanalytics.io/courses/take/python-pandas/lessons/36997236-creating-a-dataframe). 

The course covers NumPy & Pandas for Data Science, Data Analysis & Business Intelligence:

- Master the essentials of NumPy and Pandas
- Learn how to explore, transform, aggregate and join NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames
- Analyze and manipulate dates and times for time intelligence and time-series analysis
- Import and export flat files, Excel workbooks and SQL database tables using Pandas
- Visualize raw data using plot methods and common chart options like line charts, bar charts, scatter plots and histograms

## The Maven MegaMart Course Project
*Act as a Data Analyst for Maven MegaMart, a multinational corporation that operates a chain of retail and grocery stores.* 
They recently received a sample of data from a new retailer they’re looking to acquire, and they need you to identify and deliver key insights about their sales history. 

The **task** is to analyze over 2 million transactions by product, household, and store to get a better understanding of the retailer’s main strengths.
From there, you need to review the company’s discount scheme to assess whether they can expect to attract customers without losing margin. 

Use Python to:
- Read in multiple flat files efficiently
- Join tables to provide a single source of information
- Shape & aggregate sales data to calculate KPIs
- Visualize the data to communicate your findings
